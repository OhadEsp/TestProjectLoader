# TestProjectLoader
While working on my Coded UI & Unit Tests projects,
I found that the .dll files can be run via MSTest.exe.
So it was an idea to create my first WPF app, and to learn
how to do this in MVVM.
So I'm proud to introduce my WPF tests loader and would be happy
to get your comments and recommendations.
